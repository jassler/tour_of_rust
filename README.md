# Looking for translators!

If you would like to contribute translations in a language that doesn't exist yet.  Feel free to make an issue and I will modify the generator for your language.

The only file you should modify is: **lessons.json**

Adding new languages should be as simple as adding new properites per page. Let's assume we're doing spanish and your language code is "es":

* **title_es** - this would be your localized page's title
* **content_es** - this would be your localized page's content
* **code_es** - this would be your localized page's code. This is the "embedded link" generated from https://play.rust-lang.org/ when you hit the "Share" button. Be sure your run the "rustfmt" tool!

Lastly, there is a section for common words you should fill out your localized translations of for deeper experience of the site.
